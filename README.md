Fiji Macro to generate Image Panels from individual image files

This Fiji/ImageJ macro is designed to go through folders of microscopy image files and generate image panels from all images in a folder. The macro will ask for the respective folders, presence of subfolders and bit size of images. The final image panels will shift image information in 12 bit images towards the visible range in a 16bit container.
Output will be tif files.
